# In this task
Build an AI Chatbot Using NLP in Python
We developed a simple AI chatbot using Python and the natural language processing library spaCy. The chatbot is designed to recognize and respond to user queries by matching input phrases with predefined patterns. We used spaCy's en_core_web_sm language model for text processing and its PhraseMatcher tool to identify relevant phrases in the user's input. The chatbot is rule-based, meaning it relies on a list of manually defined questions and answers across topics like mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and general greetings. When a user types a question, the chatbot processes the input, searches for a matching pattern, and returns the associated response. If no match is found, it prompts the user to rephrase their question. The final product is a terminal-based program where users can interact by typing questions, and the bot replies accordingly. This project demonstrates how natural language processing can be applied to build a basic, functional chatbot without using machine learning.

Technologies Used: Python (Programming Language), spaCy (Natural Language Processing library), PhraseMatcher (for detecting known patterns/phrases)

We created a rule-based AI chatbot that can:
*Understand user input using spaCy's NLP model
*Match the input against a set of predefined question patterns using PhraseMatcher
Provide accurate, pre-programmed responses for topics like:

Math, Physics, Chemistry, General greetings and farewells

How It Works:
*Load the NLP Model: en_core_web_sm from spaCy
*Define QA Pairs: Each question has multiple patterns and one response.
*Pattern Matching: User input is compared to all known patterns using spaCyâ€™s PhraseMatcher.
*Return a Response: If a match is found, the bot returns the associated answer; otherwise, it asks the user to rephrase.
